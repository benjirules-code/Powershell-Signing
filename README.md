Creation of a Script that Signs Scripts and ties that to the device (Laptop), this script only produces Self-Signed Keys, as this script is only for signing and the scripts that we are signing do not interact with browser.

Simple Code Signing that generates RSA Keys

Code Will ask User for path of what script has to be signed

Code will pull the device name, and double check for any whitespaces, as I had issues with white spaces causing errors.

The script will also make it possible that if the code where to be copied from one device to another, then has the ability to track the issue.
